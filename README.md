# Keystroke-Essay-Score-Prediction

This is an independent prediction project using data from this database: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/linking-writing-processes-to-writing-quality/overview

The goal is to analyze key and mouse stroke patterns and predict an essay score assigned by graders, indicative of the writing's quality. I chose this project because:
1. I'm interested in keystrokes as biometric verification & for verification of academic integrity, and this is a good way to familizarize myself with methods to analyze this kind of data
2. I would like to work on prediction projects where I must generate features myself from raw data

The jupyter notebook contains sections of code organized into exploratory data analysis, rudimentary prediction, and a final pipeline that uses various machine learning models, followed by a concluding analysis of prediction accuracy from each of the methods. A pdf report will be uploaded from overleaf at the project's conclusion.

This project was initiated on November 25th, 2024 and I aim to complete this project by the end of thanksgiving weekend, 2024.
